12,"1 John 2:2","You(people) (imp) remember [that God forgives our(people’s) bad_morally actions [because Jesus Christ willingly gave/sacrificed Jesus Christ’s life for us(people)]]. Yes.

God is able [to forgive the bad_morally actions of people [who live in all places]].",,,,,,,
13,"1 John 2:3","I(John) will tell-how you(people)[you we(people) are able_B [to know [that we(people) have a good/close relationship [that is with God]]]]. {(Simple sentence version) You(people) are able_B [to have a good/close relationship [that is with God]].
